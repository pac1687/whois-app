WHOIS App
=======================

### About
This is a webapp written with a React frontend and a Node backend and Dockerized. 
It can take a Domain Name or IP Address as input and returns data from the WhoisXMLAPI WHOIS API (https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/). The Node backend wraps the RESTful WHOIS API with GraphQL.
